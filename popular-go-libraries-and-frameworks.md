# Popular Go Libraries and Frameworks

1. What are the benefits and limitations of using the standard library in Go? Can you provide an example of how you might use a standard library package in your code?

* The standard library in Go provides a rich set of packages for common tasks, offering convenience, stability, and community support. Benefits include reduced development time and increased code reliability. However, the standard library may not cover every use case, requiring the use of third-party libraries for certain specialized functionalities.

Example Go code snippet:

```go
import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    resp, err := http.Get("https://www.example.com")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
        return
    }
    defer resp.Body.Close()

    // Process the HTTP response
}
```
