# Best Practices and Coding Guidelines

1. What is the purpose of the init() function in Go? When and how is it executed?

In Go, the `init()` function is a special function that is executed automatically before the `main()` function in a package. Its purpose is to perform any initialization tasks or setup required by the package.

Here's an example to demonstrate the usage of `init()` function:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func init() {
	fmt.Println("Initializing...")
	// Perform initialization tasks here
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Main function")
	// Rest of the program
}
```

In the above code, the `init()` function is defined without any parameters or return types. It gets executed automatically before the `main()` function. In this example, it simply prints "Initializing..." to the console. The `main()` function is called after the `init()` function, and it is the entry point of the program.

When we run the code, the output will be:

```bash
Initializing...
Main function
```

The `init()` function is executed only once per package, regardless of the number of times the package is imported. If a package is imported multiple times in the same program, the `init()` function will run only once.

It's worth noting that the `init()` function is commonly used for setting up variables, initializing data structures, registering components, or performing any necessary setup actions before the program starts executing.

2. Basic Makefile to compile your `main.go` file

Here’s a basic Makefile you can use to compile your `main.go` file:

```
# Makefile for compiling main.go

# Compiler settings
GO = go
GOFLAGS = -v

# Targets
TARGET = main

# Build rules
.PHONY: all clean

all: $(TARGET)

$(TARGET): *.go
 $(GO) build $(GOFLAGS) -o $@ $^

clean:
 rm -f $(TARGET)
```

This Makefile uses `$(GO) build` to compile all the Go source files (`*.go`) in the directory into the `$(TARGET)` executable file.

Let’s break it down:

* The `#` symbol at the beginning of a line indicates a comment.
* The `GO` variable is set to the name of the Go compiler (`go`).
* The `GOFLAGS` variable is set to the compiler flags we want to use when building the executable.
* The `TARGET` variable is set to the name of the executable we want to create (`main`).
* The `.PHONY` target tells Make that `all` and `clean` are not real files, but just phony targets that don't need to be built.
* The `all` target is the default target that will be built when you run `make`. It depends on the `$(TARGET)` target.
* The `$(TARGET)` target depends on all the Go source files (`*.go`) and will be built by compiling them together using the Go compiler.
* The `$^` variable expands to all the dependencies of the target (`*.go` in this case).
* The `clean` target removes the executable file.

Here’s a more detailed explanation of how the `$(TARGET)` target works:

```
$(TARGET): *.go
 $(GO) build $(GOFLAGS) -o $@ $^
```

This rule says that the `$(TARGET)` target depends on all the Go source files (`*.go`), and that it should be built by running the `$(GO) build` command with the specified flags. Here's what each part of the command does:

* `$(GO)` expands to the name of the Go compiler (`go`).
* `build` is the name of the Go command that compiles and links Go source code to create an executable.
* `$(GOFLAGS)` expands to the compiler flags we want to use (`-v` in this case, which tells the compiler to be verbose).
* `-o $@` specifies the name of the output file (`$@` expands to the name of the target, which is `$(TARGET)` or `main` in this case).
* `$^` expands to all the dependencies of the target (`*.go` in this case), which tells the compiler to compile all the Go source files into the executable.
