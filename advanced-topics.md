1. How does Go manage memory? What are some best practices for memory management in Go?

Go uses garbage collection to manage memory, which means that the runtime automatically deallocates memory that is no longer in use by the program. This helps prevent memory leaks and other memory-related errors.

Some best practices for memory management in Go include:

* Use value types instead of pointers when possible to avoid unnecessary allocation and deallocation of memory
* Avoid creating unnecessary Goroutines, channels, and other concurrent constructs that can consume memory and reduce performance
* Use sync.Pool to reuse memory instead of allocating and deallocating it repeatedly

Example code snippet:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
)

func main() {
    var pool = sync.Pool{
        New: func() interface{} {
            return make([]byte, 1024)
        },
    }

    buffer := pool.Get().([]byte)
    defer pool.Put(buffer)

    copy(buffer, "hello, world!")
    fmt.Println(string(buffer))
}
```

2. How does Go handle garbage collection? What are some considerations for efficient memory management in Go?

Go employs automatic memory management through a concurrent garbage collector (GC). The GC in Go is responsible for reclaiming memory that is no longer in use, allowing developers to focus on writing code without manual memory deallocation.

Considerations for efficient memory management in Go include:

* Avoiding unnecessary allocations: Reusing objects or employing object pools can help reduce the number of allocations and minimize the load on the GC.
* Minimizing object sizes: Reducing the size of objects can lead to better memory utilization and decrease the pressure on the GC. Avoid storing unnecessary data within objects.
* Limiting the use of large data structures: Large data structures, such as slices or maps with a significant number of elements, can consume considerable memory. Consider alternative data structures or approaches when dealing with large data.
* Properly managing references: Avoid holding references to objects longer than necessary. Explicitly setting references to `nil` when they are no longer needed can help the GC reclaim memory more efficiently.
* Using the `sync.Pool` for temporary objects: The `sync.Pool` can be utilized to store and reuse temporary objects. This can improve performance by reducing allocations and GC overhead.
* Profiling and analyzing memory usage: Go provides tools, such as the `pprof` package and the built-in `runtime` package, for profiling and analyzing memory usage. These tools can help identify memory bottlenecks and optimize memory consumption.

Example code snippet:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"runtime"
	"runtime/debug"
)

type Object struct {
	// fields
}

func main() {
	// Enable GC
	debug.SetGCPercent(1)

	// Allocate a large number of objects
	for i := 0; i < 1000000; i++ {
		_ = &Object{}
	}

	// Request a GC cycle
	runtime.GC()

	// Retrieve memory stats
	var stats runtime.MemStats
	runtime.ReadMemStats(&stats)

	fmt.Println("HeapAlloc:", stats.HeapAlloc)
	fmt.Println("HeapReleased:", stats.HeapReleased)
}
```

In this example, the `debug.SetGCPercent` function is used to enable the GC with a relatively low threshold (1%). A large number of objects is allocated, and then a GC cycle is requested using `runtime.GC()`. The `runtime.ReadMemStats` function is employed to retrieve memory statistics, such as the amount of heap memory allocated and released. Monitoring and analyzing memory usage using such techniques can help optimize memory management in Go applications.
