1. How does Go manage memory? What are some best practices for memory management in Go?

Go uses garbage collection to manage memory, which means that the runtime automatically deallocates memory that is no longer in use by the program. This helps prevent memory leaks and other memory-related errors.

Some best practices for memory management in Go include:

* Use value types instead of pointers when possible to avoid unnecessary allocation and deallocation of memory
* Avoid creating unnecessary Goroutines, channels, and other concurrent constructs that can consume memory and reduce performance
* Use sync.Pool to reuse memory instead of allocating and deallocating it repeatedly

Example code snippet:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
)

func main() {
    var pool = sync.Pool{
        New: func() interface{} {
            return make([]byte, 1024)
        },
    }

    buffer := pool.Get().([]byte)
    defer pool.Put(buffer)

    copy(buffer, "hello, world!")
    fmt.Println(string(buffer))
}
```
