26. What is the difference between a method receiver and a function parameter in Go? How are method receivers and function parameters used differently in Go?

* In Go, a method receiver is a special parameter associated with a method that defines on which type the method is defined. It allows the method to be called on values of that specific type. In contrast, a function parameter is a variable that receives an argument when the function is called. Functions can be called independently of a specific type.

Example Go code snippet with a method receiver:

```go
type Circle struct {
    radius float64
}

func (c Circle) calculateArea() float64 {
    return math.Pi * c.radius * c.radius
}

func main() {
    circle := Circle{radius: 5}
    area := circle.calculateArea()
    fmt.Println(area)  // Output: 78.53981633974483
}
```

27. What is the difference between a pointer receiver and a value receiver in Go? When would you use a pointer receiver versus a value receiver?

* In Go, a pointer receiver is used when a method needs to modify the underlying value or when working with large struct types to avoid copying the entire value. A value receiver, on the other hand, operates on a copy of the value and is used when modifying the original value is not necessary.

Example Go code snippet with a pointer receiver:

```go
type Counter struct {
    count int
}

func (c *Counter) increment() {
    c.count++
}

func main() {
    counter := Counter{count: 0}
    counter.increment()
    fmt.Println(counter.count)  // Output: 1
}
```

28. How does Go handle interfaces? Can you provide an example of how you might use an interface in your code?

* Go uses interfaces to define a set of methods that a type must implement. Interfaces provide a way to achieve polymorphism in Go. A variable of an interface type can hold any value that implements the interface methods.

Example Go code snippet with an interface:

```go
type Shape interface {
    calculateArea() float64
}

type Rectangle struct {
    width  float64
    height float64
}

func (r Rectangle) calculateArea() float64 {
    return r.width * r.height
}

type Circle struct {
    radius float64
}

func (c Circle) calculateArea() float64 {
    return math.Pi * c.radius * c.radius
}

func printArea(s Shape) {
    area := s.calculateArea()
    fmt.Println("Area:", area)
}

func main() {
    rectangle := Rectangle{width: 5, height: 10}
    circle := Circle{radius: 3}

    printArea(rectangle)  // Output: Area: 50
    printArea(circle)     // Output: Area: 28.274333882308138
}
```

29. How are Goroutines used in Go? Can you provide an example of how you might use Goroutines in your code?

* Goroutines are lightweight concurrent functions in Go that can be executed concurrently. They allow multiple functions to be executed concurrently, enabling efficient utilization of CPU resources.

Example Go code snippet with Goroutines:

```go
func printNumbers() {
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        fmt.Println(i)
        time.Sleep(time.Second)
    }
}

func printLetters() {
    for char := 'a'; char < 'e'; char++ {
        fmt.Println(string(char))
        time.Sleep(time.Second)
    }
}

func main() {
    go printNumbers()
    go printLetters()

    time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
}
```

30. How does Go handle channels? Can you provide an example of how you might use channels in your code?

* Channels are used for communication and synchronization between Goroutines in Go. They provide a way for Goroutines to send and receive values. Channels can be used to coordinate concurrent operations.

Example Go code snippet with channels:

```go
func calculateSquare(number int, resultChan chan<- int) {
    square := number * number
    resultChan <- square
}

func main() {
    numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    resultChan := make(chan int)

    for _, number := range numbers {
        go calculateSquare(number, resultChan)
    }

    for range numbers {
        square := <-resultChan
        fmt.Println("Square:", square)
    }

    close(resultChan)
}
```
