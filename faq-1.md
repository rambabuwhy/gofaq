1. What are the key features of Go? How does it differ from other programming languages?

Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language that is designed to be efficient, expressive, and safe. Some of the key features of Go include:

* Simple syntax and minimalist design
* Built-in support for concurrency and parallelism
* Garbage collection and memory safety
* Strong typing and type inference
* Efficient compilation and execution
* Cross-platform support

Go differs from other programming languages in several ways, including its focus on simplicity, its built-in concurrency features, and its use of interfaces for polymorphism.

Example code snippet:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}
```

2. How does Go handle concurrency? What are some common patterns for concurrent programming in Go?

Go has built-in support for concurrency through Goroutines and channels. Goroutines are lightweight threads that can be started with the "go" keyword, and channels allow for communication and synchronization between Goroutines.

Some common patterns for concurrent programming in Go include:

* Fan-out/fan-in: breaking up work into smaller tasks and distributing them across multiple Goroutines, then collecting the results
* Worker pool: creating a fixed number of Goroutines to handle incoming tasks from a queue
* Pipeline: chaining together a series of Goroutines to process data in stages

Example code snippet:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func worker(id int, jobs <-chan int, results chan<- int) {
    for j := range jobs {
        fmt.Println("worker", id, "processing job", j)
        results <- j * 2
    }
}

func main() {
    jobs := make(chan int, 100)
    results := make(chan int, 100)

    for w := 1; w <= 3; w++ {
        go worker(w, jobs, results)
    }

    for j := 1; j <= 9; j++ {
        jobs <- j
    }
    close(jobs)

    for a := 1; a <= 9; a++ {
        <-results
    }
}
```

3. Explain the difference between a Goroutine and a thread. How do Goroutines achieve concurrency?

A Goroutine is a lightweight thread of execution that is managed by the Go runtime. Goroutines are similar to threads in that they can execute concurrently with other Goroutines, but they are different in several ways:

* Goroutines are managed by the Go runtime and are more lightweight than threads
* Goroutines have a much smaller stack size than threads, so many more Goroutines can be created than threads
* Goroutines are multiplexed onto a smaller number of OS threads, so they can be scheduled more efficiently

Goroutines achieve concurrency through cooperative multitasking, which means that the Go scheduler decides when to switch between Goroutines based on certain conditions, such as I/O operations or function calls.

Example code snippet:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func say(s string) {
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
        fmt.Println(s)
    }
}

func main() {
    go say("world")
    say("hello")
}
```

4. How does Go manage memory? What are some best practices for memory management in Go?

Go uses garbage collection to manage memory, which means that the runtime automatically deallocates memory that is no longer in use by the program. This helps prevent memory leaks and other memory-related errors.

Some best practices for memory management in Go include:

* Use value types instead of pointers when possible to avoid unnecessary allocation and deallocation of memory
* Avoid creating unnecessary Goroutines, channels, and other concurrent constructs that can consume memory and reduce performance
* Use sync.Pool to reuse memory instead of allocating and deallocating it repeatedly

Example code snippet:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
)

func main() {
    var pool = sync.Pool{
        New: func() interface{} {
            return make([]byte, 1024)
        },
    }

    buffer := pool.Get().([]byte)
    defer pool.Put(buffer)

    copy(buffer, "hello, world!")
    fmt.Println(string(buffer))
}
```

5. How does Go support functional programming? What are some key features of Go that make it suitable for functional programming?

Go supports functional programming through its support for higher-order functions, closures, and first-class functions. Go also has some built-in functions, such as map, reduce, and filter, that are commonly used in functional programming.

Some key features of Go that make it suitable for functional programming include:

* Its support for closures and first-class functions, which allow functions to be passed as arguments and returned as results from other functions
* Its support for immutable data structures, such as arrays and maps
* Its built-in support for anonymous functions, which can be used to create function literals
* Its support for interfaces, which can be used to create generic functions

Example code snippet:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Mapper func(int) int

func mapInts(a []int, f Mapper) []int {
    b := make([]int, len(a))
    for i, v := range a {
        b[i] = f(v)
    }
    return b
}

func main() {
    a := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

    b := mapInts(a, func(x int) int {
        return x * 2
    })

    fmt.Println(b)
}
```
